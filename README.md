# NutriGen: A Multi-Modal Recipe Generative Framework for Personalized Nutritional Synthesis

## Overview

**What is my project?**
NutriGen is a multi-modal generative framework designed for personalized nutritional synthesis. It addresses the critical challenge of inaccurate and inconsistent nutritional information in online recipes by implementing a robust data pipeline. My framework calculates precise nutritional data from scratch by parsing unstructured recipe ingredients and matching them against the comprehensive Open Food Facts database. After building the clean nutrition foundation for my project I trained two of generative AI models: a **CTGAN** to synthesize realistic nutritional profiles for tailored dietary needs, and a **Transformer model** to generate complete, coherent cooking instructions from the ingredient and nutritional data.

**Why does it matter?**
In an age of health-conscious eating and personalized nutrition, reliable data is paramount. Most online recipes provide opaque and untrustworthy nutritional estimates. NutriGen aims to bring transparency and accuracy to recipe nutrition, empowering users to make informed dietary choices. By generating novel cooking instructions from specified nutritional targets, I explored the creative frontier of AI in the culinary arts, paving the way for advanced applications in dynamic meal planning and automated recipe creation.

**For whom is my project for?**
My project is for data scientists, nutritionists, developers in the food-tech space, and anyone interested in the application of NLP, generative models, and data engineering to solve complex, real-world problems.
And I built this project as my portfolio style end-to-end system including data processing, model training and evaluation.

## Talking about my Working Process: From Problem to Solution

My methodology is broken down into four key stages, transforming raw, unstructured recipe data into a generative model capable of creating new instructions.

### Step 1: Establishing a Data Foundation & Nutritional Benchmark

I began my project by aggregating three diverse datasets to build a holistic view of food consumption and recipe composition.

### Data Sources I used

**Allrecipes Dataset**
*The primary source of raw recipe text, providing the ingredients and instructions used for my core analysis and generation tasks.*

| Source                        | Type                      | Records            | Key Features Used                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Allrecipes.com (Scraped Data) | Recipe Text & Metadata    | ~38,000 recipes    | `title`, `ingredients`, `instructions`     |

**Open Food Facts (OFF)**
*The nutritional backbone of my project, used as a ground-truth database to calculate accurate nutrition for individual ingredients.*

| Source             | Type                         | Records                | Key Features Used                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Open Food Facts    | Nutritional Product Database | ~4.1 million products  | `product_name`, `energy_100g`, `proteins_100g`, `carbohydrates_100g`, `fat_100g` |

**National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)**
*A statistical benchmark of real-world dietary intake, used to validate the plausibility of the calculated recipe nutrition.*

| Source                               | Type                            | Records                                                   | Key Features Used                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Centers for Disease Control (CDC)    | Health and Nutrition Survey     | ~23,000 daily records (from ~12,400 respondents, 2017-2020) | `energy_kcal`, `protein_g`, `carbs_g`, `fat_g`, demographic data |

---

![NHANES Nutritional Distributions](assets/1.png)*I did this data visualization to quickly understand what normal nutrition looks like in real life and to set a baseline for my project. These plots showed me the typical ranges and the average daily intake for calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, and sugar in the NHANES data. This helped me compare my recipe nutrition against a real benchmark and check whether my calculated results looked realistic before training my models.*

![NHANES Demographic Distributions](assets/2.png)
*I also did some EDA on the NHANES demographic data to understand who the survey represents and how nutrition patterns can change across different groups. My plots showed me the gender split, the age spread of participants, and how daily calorie intake differs by gender. This helped me confirm that my benchmark data is diverse and realistic, and it gave me more context when comparing my recipe nutrition results to real-world intake patterns..*

I first cleaned all datasets and converted the raw, unstructured recipe text into a structured format like standardized ingredients, units, and nutrition fields. So my models could train on consistent and reliable data.

### Step 2: Engineering the Nutritional Calculation Pipeline

This stage was my project's core data engineering challenge: to replace unreliable, scraped nutritional data with verifiable, calculated values.

*   **I used an advanced ingredient parsing technique:** I developed a custom function to intelligently parse unstructured ingredient strings (e.g., "1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained") into structured components: a numeric `quantity`, a standardized `unit` (e.g., 'cup', 'oz'), and a cleaned `ingredient name`.

*   **Also did High-Speed Fuzzy Matching:** I matched the cleaned ingredient names from every recipe against the 4 million products in the Open Food Facts database. I achieved this using `rapidfuzz`, a high-performance fuzzy string matching library. This useful step allowed me to link a recipe ingredient like "all-purpose flour" to a specific food product with known nutritional values, achieving **72.9% coverage** across nearly 19,000 unique ingredients.

*   **Nutrition Aggregation and Validation:** With each ingredient successfully matched, I calculated the total calories, protein, carbs, and fat for each recipe. And aggregated the nutritional values of its components, carefully adjusted for the specified quantities and units. My final per-serving nutrition was then benchmarked against the NHANES per-meal averages to ensure my calculations were realistic, ultimately producing a clean, reliable dataset for over **33,000 recipes**.

![Recipe vs NHANES Benchmark](assets/3.png)
*I calculated per-serving calories, protein, carbs, and fat for each recipe using my nutrition calculation pipeline. Then I compared my recipe per-meal nutrition distributions to the NHANES benchmark by dividing NHANES daily intake into three meals. I observed that the distributions overlap well and the average calories are very close, which tells me my calculated recipe nutrition is realistic and nutritionally plausible. I also noticed that my recipe data has a longer high end tail, meaning some recipes are much higher than a typical NHANES meal, especially for calories and fat, which reflects real-world variation in meal sizes and recipe richness.*

### Step 3: Generating Synthetic Nutritional Profiles with a CTGAN

To explore the possibility of creating recipes for specific dietary needs, I moved into the realm of generative AI.

*   **Objective:** I trained a **Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN)** to learn the complex, multi-dimensional statistical distribution of my newly calculated nutritional data.

*   **Application & Evaluation:** My trained CTGAN can generate new, synthetic, yet highly realistic nutritional profiles on demand. For instance, it can produce data for recipes that are "high-protein and low-fat" while maintaining plausible correlations between all nutrients. I validated my model's performance by comparing the statistical properties like mean, standard deviation and correlations of the synthetic data to the real data, showing a very close match.

![CTGAN Synthetic vs Real Distributions](assets/4.png)
*My KDE plots results shows that the synthetic data closely follows the real data patterns for calories, protein, carbs and fat. As the curves overlap well, it means my CTGAN model learned the original data distribution and can generate realistic nutritional profiles.*

![CTGAN Correlation Heatmaps](assets/5.png)
*From my correlation analysis, I confirmed that my GAN preserved the main nutrient relationships from the real data, especially that calories move together with carbs and fat. From this, I understood that the synthetic nutrition profiles are realistic and not random.*

### Step 4: Generating Cooking Instructions with a Transformer Model

My final and most ambitious stage was to build a model capable of writing complete, coherent cooking instructions from scratch.

*   **Model Architecture:** I implemented a **sequence-to-sequence Transformer**, a neural network architecture for NLP tasks. The model's input was a formatted string containing a recipe's ingredients and its target nutritional profile, and its output was the step-by-step instructions.

*   **Training and Refinement:** Training such a complex model presented challenges, including instability and nonsensical output in early iterations. I resolved these issues by implementing a more sophisticated training regimen, which included a **warm-up learning rate scheduler**, proper weight initialization, and scaled embeddings to ensure stable convergence. Then I trained my model on my cleaned dataset of over 26,000 high-quality recipes.

*   **Evaluation and Results:** I evaluated the model's performance using the **BLEU score**, a standard metric for measuring the similarity between machine-generated text and a human reference. While the quantitative scores indicated that my model is a strong baseline with room for improvement, qualitative analysis showed me that it successfully learned to generate grammatically correct and contextually relevant instructions that follow a logical cooking sequence.
